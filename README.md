# shadcn-ui-lib-starter
A simple starter kit to build your own shadcn-ui library using components from https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components

### Features
- Tree-shakeable (components you don't use won't be included in your bundle)
- Dark mode support
- Override library styles with your own using tailwindcss or your own css

### Wanna see how this library works ?

Run the example project and play around

The example project has the published npm package linked so you do not really have to do a local npm link.

```
cd examples/vite-tailwind-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
